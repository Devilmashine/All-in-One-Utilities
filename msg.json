"message":"(Note: If you do not use iTweak, please press “No” to ignore this message.)\n\nIn order to meet RoutineHub’s new rules, iTweak will be updated to the latest discontinued RoutineHub version (V6.1). If you want to keep using piracy-related features, STAY ON VERSION 55.3! There’s a possibility that all older versions of All-in-One Utilities will also be updated to the new iTweak.\n\nI am extremely sorry for anyone who uses the iTweak utility. More messages might be sent if more information about iTweak is available.\n\n(Also, if you want to disable messages, just disable Semi-automatic update checking in “Settings>Change Preferences>Setup Assistant”)\n\nPress “Yes” to go to RoutineHub rules, press “No” to ignore.",
